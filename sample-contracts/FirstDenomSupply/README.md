# FirstDenomSupply

This is a smart contract with two methods. It uses the `bank` precompile to query the supply of Cosmos-native tokens on the chain. These are tokens that are accessible both via Cosmos SDK and the EVM.

## Deploy

* Create a new project
```
forge init denom-project
cd denom-project
```

* Copy [FirstDenomSupply.sol](FirstDenomSupply.sol) to the `src` folder.
  * This is a smart contract with two methods. It uses the bank precompile to query the supply of Cosmos-native tokens on the chain.
* Place your private key in a variable
```
ETH_PRIV_KEY=$(evmd keys unsafe-export-eth-key my-wallet)
```
* Create the contract
```
forge create src/FirstDenomSupply.sol:FirstDenomSupply --private-key $ETH_PRIV_KEY
```
* Broadcast the transaction
```
forge create src/FirstDenomSupply.sol:FirstDenomSupply --private-key $ETH_PRIV_KEY --broadcast
```
The broadcast command will result in something like this:

```
The `Deployed to` field represents the contract address. Export it to a variable so we can use it in the next section:
```
CONTRACT_ADDR=<"Deployed to" address>
```

## Execute

The contract has two methods: `getFirstDenomSupply()` and `getDenomCount()`. We will call the first one. It will return a `uint64`, indicating the total supply of that denom, and an Ethereum address, which is the ERC20 address for that denom in the EVM.

* Call `cast call` to run the `getFirstDenomSupply()` method
```
cast call $CONTRACT_ADDR 'getFirstDenomSupply()' --private-key $ETH_PRIV_KEY
```
This will return a glob of hex similar to this:
```
0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006fc4230e4000000000000000000000000ea1b9540ec1f2170718caff6f0083c966fffed0b
```
This is the hex-encoded binary response to the smart contract call. `cast` can decode it using the contract's signature:
```
cast decode-abi 'getFirstDenomSupply()(uint256 amount, address contractAddress)' 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006fc4230e4000000000000000000000000ea1b9540ec1f2170718caff6f0083c966fffed0b
30002000100 [3e10]
0xEA1b9540eC1f2170718Caff6F0083C966fFFEd0B
```

These are the decoded contents of the hex string returned by `cast call`. The first line tells us there are `3e10` tokens, and the second line tells us this particular token has an address of `0xEA1b9540eC1f2170718Caff6F0083C966fFFEd0B`.
